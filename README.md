# Grind It Out

## Introduction
A "grind" is a series of tasks or completion of certain objectives to obtain a certain item/items in a video game.  
This application will solve the issue of long winded grind explanations in games for gamers. 
The app will allow them to use their own words and make it easy to read for them 
and assist them with getting that sweet special loot.

## Motivation for Project
I always struggled with reading walls and walls of text when I look up guides to
see how to get that special gear I wanted in a game I'm playing. I wanted a way 
for people like me(and just me) to be able to make our own little guides quickly and easily in our own words. 

## Application Function
Current functionality allows for registration of a user, 
creation of a grind for an existing game, 
addition of a game to the existing database, 
and the ability to mark a grind as completed. 

## Application Development
React, CSS and a lot of stress was involved in the development of this project. 
As it was my first solo app, I was responsible for planning and re-planning and 
re-re-planning each step to see the project come to completion. 

## Installation and Running
App currently demands the usage of the Terminal command "npm start". 
Apart from that, download the code and run it how you normally would, 
then run it using a local host using the previously stated command.


## Challenges Presented
This was my first solo app, so the greatest challenges to me were the ones presented by that kind of freedom.
I could make anything! Well, anything I had the ability to make. 
I knew that my plans would have to change based on
my own skill level, but I was still able to achieve most of what I had planned to make! 
React and the syntax specific to JSX 
presented some challenges along the way, 
but even greater than that was learning to ask google the right questions! I saw errors
during this project I had never seen before and I had to learn a good bit about some newer things.
